Description: NT SAM password recovery utility
 This little program provides a way to view information and
 change user passwords in a Windows NT/2000 user database file.
 Old passwords need not be known since they are overwritten.
 In addition it also contains a simple registry editor 
 (same size data writes) and an hex-editor which enables you to
 fiddle around with bits and bytes in the file as you wish.
 .
 If you want GNU/Linux bootdisks for offline password recovery
 you can add this utility to custom image disks or use those provided
 at the tools homepage.
